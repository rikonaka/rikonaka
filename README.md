### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Artificial Intelligence Security and Cyberspace Security.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to love.
- ðŸ˜„ Some of the interesting tools I implemented:
  - [pistol](https://github.com/rikonaka/pistol-rs), a rust library about cybersecurity, and you can use the scanning and probing in your rust code now!
  - [diskwatcher](https://github.com/rikonaka/diskwatcher-rs), a simple file modification monitor for security competition defence to detect files change on your Linux server!
  - [translator](https://github.com/rikonaka/translator-rs), a translation software that works very well when reading papers in a Linux environment!
  - [subnetwork](https://github.com/rikonaka/subnetwork-rs), a very fast subnet processing library for rust, faster than any other similar library! (the benchmark is [here](https://github.com/rikonaka/subnetwork-rs/tree/main/benchmark))
  - [gcdx](https://github.com/rikonaka/gcdx-rs), a rust library for calculating gcd values in an array!
  - [lcmx](https://github.com/rikonaka/lcmx-rs), a rust library for calculating lcm values in an array!
  - [aoit](https://github.com/rikonaka/aoit-rs), apt offline installation tool, you can package all the dependencies of the software and install it offline!
  - [poit](https://github.com/rikonaka/poit-rs), pip offline installation tool, you can package all the dependencies of the software and install it offline!
  - [rssql](https://github.com/rikonaka/rssql), struct-agnostic rust sql tool.
  - [LucQ](https://github.com/rikonaka/LucQ-rs), adding and removing Linux commands to the queue at any time!
